##### **Bio:** *Velan was born to the Njxinn Birthing Tarn in Ixiiz, to the dynasty of Bloody Crisps. Being assigned to be under the apprenticeship (not to be confused with the learning ship 'Apprenticeship') of Jie Pnixxi Ijniik. From a young age Velan was anti-social, critisising the inner workings of social interaction and viewing it as a meaningless device to gain power. From him, Velan was taught the art of charting, stippling and close quarter combat, during this time he took interest to the outside universe, hearing tales of inspiration about the great Construct, wishing to join their cause. After his graduation and acquirement of the Nixj dagger (A rite of passage for those in the Bloody Crisps dynasty) Velan followed to find a method of service to the Construct, starting as a station communicator for the Pjink Palace landing bay, where he eventually had to learn Garrancha and Yartech for communication. Fortunatly, everyone could pronounce his name because it wasnt gay, and it didnt sound like a packet of crisps either. He followed to be promoted as the Comms of a Construct research team (Requeronihil-J324) researching the effects of dark matter in the Grand Powder Collection. Proceeding 3 years of service aboard the Quesitonihil, the job became unrewarding and uninteresting, though he learnt the languages of Humanic and Goroen, whilst also meeting various individuals. He went on to live off of the struks marcs he had made travelling between systems, avoiding interaction.*
