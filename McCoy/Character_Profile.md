After his graduation and acquirement of the Nixj dagger (A rite of passage for those in the Ijnik dynasty) Krin followed to find a method of service to the Construct, starting as a station communicator for the Pjink Palace landing bay, where he eventually had to learn Garrancha and Yartech for communication.

He followed to be promoted as the Comms of a Construct research team (Requeronihil-J324) researching the effects of dark matter in the Grand Powder Collection. Proceeding 3 years of service aboard the Quesitonihil, the job became unrewarding and uniteresting, though he learnt the languages of Humanic and Goroen, whilst also meeting various individuals. He followed onto live of the struks marcs he had made traveling between systems, avoiding interaction.*
