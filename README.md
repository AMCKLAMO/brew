### Please save you characters files within your own directory. General files regarding the game mechanics or setting information can be stored within a directory of your choice (with a name relevant to the content).

### Please make sure that your commit information and filenames are descriptive so that it is simple to locate them later. Reverts can be made if necessary, just @ me.
