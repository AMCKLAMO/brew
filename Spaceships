# __***Spaceships***__
## **Guide on Spaceships:**
### *The majority of Spaceships present in the galaxy will follow a de facto format of the quarters. There are a few necessary rooms, however others may be added to improve efficiency, weapons arsenal, storage or leisure spaces. All quarters take up a certain allotted amount of space, and will cost a certain amount to place and build. The basis of this building measurement is a 'Quarter', which is the size of a basic room.*

### *The most simple form of spaceship is one containing a pilot room (cockpit), storage room and engine (both engine room and engine itself for full functionality)*

`example of how a simple spaceship could be like`

# **Quarters:**
- **Engine**
  - *Engine:* Most ships present rely on ion propulsion, which contains an engine that will take up a single quarter.
  - *Engine Room:* Where most maintenance will be done, the room will have to be directly linked to the engine if present. This room is not necessary, however if not present, the maintenance of the engine can only be done when landed or stationary in space.  
- **Pilot Room:** The room is required in any manually piloted ship. The room is two quarters in length.
- **Storage: ** Any ship that requires to transport items will have a cargo room.

# **Engine:**
*The ion thruster being the most cheaply made and readily available engine. The main fuel source is _Xenon_, as it is commonly produced in [David put a name here plz] which is constantly bombarded by radioactive particles, causing constant nuclear fission on the planet's surface*
