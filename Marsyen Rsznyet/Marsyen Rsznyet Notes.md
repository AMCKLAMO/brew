### **Birthplace:** *Vius, Srellian Binary System*
##### **Biography:** *Rsznyet was born on Vius, a desert planet located in the centre of the Srellian Binary System. As a descendant of ancient warriors, he became involved with the tribal wars that occurred at his home as an adolescent. After training with the Vian Militia in his early adulthood and proving his raw strength and power to the tribal leaders, he became a key fighter in the Vius Civil War, where he lead several platoons into a bloody and choked battle, resulting in a hard-fought victory to the Militia. Rsznyet was subsequently promoted to Chief of Warfare, a title known as "Taas" in the ancient Vian tribal culture, a name describing the honourable spirit within the Chief. However, his aggressive leadership was not valued amongst some tribe members, who attempted an assassination against him. To protect himself, Rsznyet fled his home planet and arrived on the nearby planet Difali, where he utilised his notoriety as Taas to become the military advisor to the Royal Guard, a position he lost after only one year due to an overwhelming coup by the Difali People's Army. To protect himself from any further danger, he moved out of the Srellian system and into smugglers territory, taking many security contracts to passing freighters attempting to ship contraband and illegal weapons through pirate territory. He became somewhat popular during his many visits to Ereide, attracting many important party-goers for his protection services.*
